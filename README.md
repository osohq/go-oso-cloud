# Oso Cloud Client for Go

[![Slack][badge-slack]][badge-slack-link]

The Oso Cloud client for Go provides a convenient wrapper around the Oso
Cloud HTTP API for applications and services written in Go.

## What is Oso Cloud?
Oso Cloud is authorization-as-a-service. It provides abstractions for building
and iterating on authorization in your application â€“ based on years of work
with hundreds of engineering teams.

- Model: Build your authorization model using primitives for common patterns
  like multi-tenancy and RBAC. Express custom rules using Polar, a
  declarative policy language for authorization.

- Store: Store your authorization data using a best-practices data model and
  use it for access decisions across all of your services.

- Enforce & Query: Add enforcement calls to your application to perform
  yes/no permission checks, filter resources by permissions, list a user's
  roles, and show/hide pieces of your UI.

- Test & Watch: Write tests over your authorization policies before you push
  them live. See logs of authorization decisions in real time.
